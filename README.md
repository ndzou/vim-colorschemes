Vim colorschemes
================

My fork of flazz's color scheme collection.

Changes from flazz's branch, remove the following files that are not color schemes (but are syntax files instead):

* ciscoacl.vim
* pic.vim
* psql
* rtl.vim
* scala.vim

Remove the following that messes up color setting after using:

* adobe.vim

Modified the following schemes that changes user setting:

* af.vim (modifies modeline)
* darkroom.vim (modifies current buffer)
* potts.vim (modifies font)
* smyck.vim (modifies linespace)

Added one color scheme:

* calmar256-dark.vim (to complement the existing calmar256-light)

In general I won't add new color schems, but instead will only remove existing problematic ones.
